Hello there! I am excited to introduce myself as someone with a deep passion for building interactive experiences and solving problems before they arise.

My advanced knowledge of Object-Oriented JavaScript, modern JS libraries like VUE and NUXT, ES6, and Responsive design tactics allows me to craft engaging web experiences that captivate users.

Furthermore, my experience with LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/LARAVEL) gives me the expertise to build robust web applications that are both reliable and efficient.

In addition to my technical skills, I am experienced in AWS server management, including Amazon Route 53 and Amazon EC2 Instance. This allows me to manage web applications efficiently and ensure that they are running seamlessly.

Moreover, I am well-versed in Git and server Git-flow, which enables me to collaborate with teams and ensure streamlined workflow.

In addition to my technical skills and passion for building exceptional experiences, I am also well-versed in agile methodologies and an expert in Scrum Master.

My experience with agile methodologies has given me a solid foundation in project management, enabling me to collaborate effectively with teams and stakeholders to achieve project goals. As an expert in Scrum Master, I am skilled in facilitating Agile ceremonies, including daily standups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.

Working with Agile and being an expert in Scrum Master has taught me the importance of communication, transparency, and collaboration, and I strive to incorporate these values into all aspects of my work.

I am confident that my expertise in Agile and Scrum Master, combined with my technical skills and passion for building exceptional experiences, make me an ideal candidate for any project or team.
